# FSTimeSync

A small tool to keep your flight simulator time in sync with GMT.

Does nothing else really.

## Install

[Download the latest `Application.zip` package](https://github.com/pedro2555/FSTimeSync/releases/latest) and extract it to a location of your choice (I advise using the sim root folder, but makes no difference really).

Execute `FSTimeSync.exe`, with your sim open, click twice on the only big button; and there you go, your sim will be updated every so often if needed be to keep time in sync with real UTC.
